    "# \n",
    "*  This notebook demonstrates the text chunking functionality for financial complaint analysis.\n",
    "# \n",
    "### What This Notebook Shows:\n",
    "  - **Basic Chunking**: Simple text splitting with configurable parameters\n",
    "  - **Multiple Methods**: Different chunking strategies (recursive character, sentence-based, paragraph-based)\n",
    "  - **Parameter Experimentation**: Finding optimal chunking parameters for your data\n",
    "  - **Real Data Integration**: Processing actual financial complaint narratives\n",
    "  - **Performance Analysis**: Metrics and insights about chunking effectiveness\n",
    "\n",
    " ### Key Features:\n",
    "  - Import and use the text chunking module from the `src` directory\n",
    "  - Run various demonstrations of chunking strategies\n",
    "  - Process actual complaint data from CSV files\n",
    "  - Analyze chunking performance and save results\n",
    "  - Export chunked data for further analysis\n",
    "# \n",
    " ### Notebook Structure:\n",
    "*  The notebook is organized into cells that progressively build up the demonstration:\n",
    "  1. **Setup**: Import modules and configure paths\n",
    "  2. **Basic Demo**: Simple text chunking examples\n",
    "  3. **Method Comparison**: Different chunking approaches\n",
    "  4. **Parameter Tuning**: Finding optimal settings\n",
    "  5. **Real Data**: Processing actual complaint narratives\n",
    "  6. **Analysis**: Performance metrics and results\n",
    "# \n",
    " ### Expected Outputs:\n",
    "  - Chunked narratives saved as CSV files\n",
    "  - Performance summaries and metrics\n",
    "  - Visualizations of chunking effectiveness\n",
    "  - Recommendations for optimal parameters\n"
